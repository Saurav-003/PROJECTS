# 🔐 LSB Steganography Tool

A simple Python GUI application that allows you to hide (encode) and extract (decode) secret messages inside images using **Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography**.  
This version also supports **Base64 encoding** as an extra option to make messages harder to interpret.


## 🚀 Features
- Encode secret messages into PNG, JPG, or BMP images  
- Decode hidden messages from encoded images  
- Optional **Base64 encoding/decoding** for added obfuscation  
- User-friendly **GUI built with PyQt5**  
- Saves the output image as `encoded.png` in the same folder
